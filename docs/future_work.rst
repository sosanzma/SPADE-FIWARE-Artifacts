Upcoming Development: Subscription Artifact
-------------------------------------------


The current development focus is on creating a Subscription Artifact, a key component that will enable SPADE agents to receive and process real-time updates from FIWARE Context Brokers. This document outlines the technical aspects and functionality of this new artifact.
Subscription Artifact Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Subscription Artifact is being designed with the following key components:

Subscription Manager:

Handles the creation, updating, and deletion of subscriptions with the Context Broker.
Maintains a registry of active subscriptions.


Notification Receiver:

Sets up a web server to receive HTTP POST notifications from the Context Broker.
Processes incoming notifications and extracts relevant data.


Data Processor:

Transforms received notifications into a format suitable for SPADE agents.
Implements filtering and condition checking on incoming data.


SPADE Integration Layer:

Facilitates communication between the Subscription Artifact and SPADE agents.
Utilizes SPADE's artifact system for seamless integration.



Functionality and Features

Subscription Configuration:

Support for entity-specific and type-based subscriptions.
Ability to specify attributes of interest for each subscription.
Configuration of notification conditions (e.g., attribute value thresholds).


Dynamic Subscription Management:

Runtime addition, modification, and removal of subscriptions.
Automatic resubscription in case of connection loss or subscription expiration.


Notification Handling:

Asynchronous processing of incoming notifications.
Queuing system to manage high volumes of notifications.
Error handling for malformed or unexpected notifications.


Data Filtering and Transformation:

Implementation of customizable filters to process incoming data.
Transformation of NGSI-LD data to formats easily consumable by SPADE agents.


Integration with SPADE Behaviors:

Direct mapping of notifications to SPADE agent behaviors.
Support for triggering specific agent actions based on notification content.


Scalability Considerations:

Design to handle multiple simultaneous subscriptions efficiently.
Implementation of throttling mechanisms to prevent overwhelming the SPADE system.



Technical Implementation Details

NGSI-LD Compliance:

Full support for NGSI-LD subscription format and notification structure.
Handling of context information and JSON-LD data.


Asynchronous Operations:

Use of Python's asyncio for non-blocking I/O operations.
Asynchronous HTTP client for communication with the Context Broker.


Web Server Component:

Lightweight web server (e.g., aiohttp) to receive notifications.
Configurable endpoint for Context Broker callbacks.


This Subscription Artifact aims to provide a robust and flexible mechanism for SPADE agents to interact with FIWARE Context Brokers in real-time, enabling the development of responsive and context-aware multi-agent systems.
